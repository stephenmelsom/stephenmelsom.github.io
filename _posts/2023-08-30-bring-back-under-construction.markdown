At the risk of mildly dating myself, I want to reminisce on the days where we encountered the "Under Construction" pages with the road fences and signs. These relics are really no longer necessary with modern publishing tools and the encroaching automation of AI/ML written articles. And while it's only a feeling of mild nostalgia, it's a reminder of a time when webpages were mere kilobytes and weren't tracking every click I made in order to recommend the next $400 mushroom-shaped lamp I apparently need.
